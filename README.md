# Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning

This project aims to forecast future demand using historical data and machine learning models. It explores different time series forecasting techniques, including ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost, to predict demand for the upcoming months.

## Data

The project uses a dataset containing historical demand data over time. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and convert date columns to the appropriate format.

## Models

The following models are explored:

1. **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A statistical model used for univariate time series analysis and forecasting.
2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** A type of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for time series forecasting.
3. **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** A powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its high accuracy and efficiency.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned and prepared for modeling by handling missing values, converting date columns to datetime objects, and creating lagged features.
2. **Model Training:** Each model is trained on a portion of the historical data (training set).
3. **Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated on a held-out portion of the data (testing set) using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
4. **Forecasting:** The best-performing model is used to forecast future demand.

## Results

The project compares the performance of different models and provides insights into the most accurate approach for demand forecasting. It also presents visualizations of the actual demand versus the forecasted demand.

## Usage

To run the code:

1. Install the required libraries: `!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn statsmodels tensorflow xgboost`
2. Load the dataset.
3. Execute the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to demand forecasting. It provides a framework for building and evaluating different models to achieve accurate predictions. By using the insights gained from this project, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize their operations and improve their bottom line.
